# 🧠 My Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repo documents my hands-on journey to learn Machine Learning (ML) from scratch. It includes code, notes, small projects, and experiments I'm doing as I progress through various ML concepts and algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a solid understanding of Machine Learning by learning theory and applying it through practical projects. Eventually, master core ML techniques and get comfortable with real-world applications and datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Later) TensorFlow / PyTorch
